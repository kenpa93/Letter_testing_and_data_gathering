# Letter_testing_and_data_gathering
This code is meant to show programmers that without data algorithms are not possible to be made
so this program is created with limited data like three letter word "how"
in this we gether what user entered and see the accuracy of typed word
basically what this program is meant to be the is every letter like 
adding the letter to the prompt many people enter the wrong letter hence 
the program still understand what user want to say so that what it was suppose to do
This program is meant to inspire the coders so please enjoy and tweak it however ypu like it will be publically available
Thank you
